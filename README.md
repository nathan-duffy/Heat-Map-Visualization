## Regional Heat Maps


**Overview:**

These visualizations were completed during my internship with Lotus Trolley Bag during the summer of 2019.  In the first few weeks
that I was a part of the company, they were fortunate enough to get on Good Morning America.  Shortly after this aired they had
access to a large amount of sales data and wished to visualize it to understand regionally where their orders were coming from. 
I was able to show how useful a heat map would be for this scenerio.  I then went on to populate a United States map with heated
colors to help Lotus Trolley Bag understand where their orders were coming from.  **Matplotlib** was utilized for these visualizations.

**What I Learned:**

•	How to populate a .shp file with data.
<br>
•	The importance of regional visualizations in marketing tactics.
<br>
•	How to finish and understand where visualizations fit into the bigger picture.
